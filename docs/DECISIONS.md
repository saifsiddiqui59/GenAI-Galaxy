# Decisions

- Maintain original V3 topic keys (`branch / group / title`) for cloud and guest progress compatibility.
- Keep exactly 17 original main chapters/planets; add discovered topics within the existing hierarchy (now 55 groups).
- Pure CSS planet surfaces, orbital transform animation and static Canvas starfield avoid a heavyweight WebGL dependency; use compositor transforms and honor OS reduced motion.
- **No multiple choice.** Open-answer textbox and speech recognition. Keyword rubric is explicitly not a semantic grading service.
- Browser SpeechRecognition is initial STT; optional Azure Speech adapter only with authenticated HTTPS token broker and time-limited access tokens, no frontend provider secrets.
- Store private documents only after sign-in; use existing RLS-enabled Supabase metadata table and private storage bucket; limit upload to existing 8 MiB bucket quota.
- Leave the V3 source as an immutable reference. No RetailGrowthAI or WineShopPOS changes.
- No Azure or GitHub resource creation without approval. Local Git work may proceed; remote remains blocked.
